# Machine-Learning-KNN-Classifier
Different experiments were conducted on OCR and IRIS dataset to observe n fold cross validation error for different n and to study the behavior of KNN classifier under label noise. Observations: Classification error increases as the samplesâ€™ labels are changed and increased every time we run the classifier.
Software used: OCTAVE
Contains two folders with projects on OCR and IRIS dataset using KNN Classifier
Classification Error vs 1-Nearest neighbor
Run and see the matlab files which outputs different plots of training errors
